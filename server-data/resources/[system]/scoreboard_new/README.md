# Stadus_Scoreboard
A lot of people were really interested in our Scoreboard and since I thought about shutting down my community. I want to give back something to the FiveM Community!

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Replace your scoreboard by going into [system] and simply replace "scoreboard" with our.
2. Put scoreboard after es_extended in server.cfg
3. Profit?!?!?!?

How to make a Custom logo?
Go in to scoreboard/html and replace newlogo.png with your own.

Credits:
Thanks to the FiveM-team for the initial version of the scoreboard.

I would really appreciate if you would leave the watermark "made by Stadus".


NOTE!!!
I won't help with any support whatsoever.
