**About**
Hello fellow people of the FiveM forums. Today I present to you a script that I have come and passed, in terms of wanting to make this. The past days I said f*ck it and did it. So this script gives *your* officers the ability to request backup from the other officers. It send the location and sets a cool little way-point ;)

**Features**
- Commands to alert others of location and backup level
- Multiple backup levels (1, 2, 3, 99)
- Ped white-list so the alert only goes to the set peds
- Alert sounds for the higher bk levels (3 & 99)
- Notifications above map for a clean look
- Map way-point set on initiating officer
-  Location in message for easy knowledge of area
